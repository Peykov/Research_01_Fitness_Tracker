    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that can be used for machine learning. This involves selecting the most useful features from the raw data and using them to build or create new features that represent the information in the dataset in a more effective way. These new, engineered features can make it easier for machine learning models to learn from the data and make more accurate predictions when done righ\n",

    "\n",
    "A Butterworth low-pass filter is a type of filter that is used to remove high frequency noise from a dataset. It is most commonly used in machine learning in order to improve the accuracy of the model. The filter works by removing any data points above a certain threshold frequency, while still preserving the underlying pattern of the data. By doing so, it helps to reduce the effect of noise on the model, which can lead to better results.\n",

    "## Principal component analysis (PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is a technique used in machine learning to reduce the complexity of data by transforming the data into a new set of variables called principal components. This transformation is done in such a way that the new set of variables captures the most amount of information from the original data set, while reducing the number of variables necessary. This helps to reduce the complexity of the data and make it easier to analyze and make predictions from.\n",

    "### Elbow technique\n",
    "\n",
    "The elbow technique is a method used to determine the optimal number of components to use when conducting a PCA. It works by testing multiple different component numbers and then evaluating the variance captured by each component number. The optimal component number is then chosen as the number of components that capture the most variance while also not incorporating too many components. This is done by plotting the variance captured against the component number and then selecting the point at which the rate of change in variance diminishes (the \"elbow\"), as this is typically the point at which adding more components does not significantly improve the analysis."
